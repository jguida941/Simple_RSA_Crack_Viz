## Features
##  Overview

**MiniRSA_Breaker** is an interactive PyQt6 application that visualizes the RSA encryption and decryption process for educational and instructional use.

It demonstrates how password encryption can be reversed using only **modular arithmetic**, **character mapping**, and **key pair generation**. The system uses actual RSA rules and runs fully offline.

This tool is a simplified branch of a more advanced RSA-cracking system, **Breacher**, and focuses on foundational mathematical insight.
