This project allows interactive RSA encryption and decryption with full step-by-step visual feedback.

Use it to:
- Teach RSA key concepts
- Break down modular exponentiation
- Compare weak vs. strong keys
- 
Whether you're a **teacher**, a **CS student**, or just **someone fascinated by how passwords work**,  
**this tool was built for you**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *This **won't teach you how** to break secure RSA encryption.*  
> But... with the **right math and curiosity**, thats **a different story**, lets keep it at that.

# ‚ú® Features

**RSA Key Generation**  
Generate custom or random small prime keys instantly.

**Modular Exponentiation Engine**  
Performs `c = m^e mod n` and `m = c^d mod n` using Python‚Äôs `pow()` function, real, fast RSA behavior.

**Character Mapping System**  
Maps characters **A‚ÄìZ** to integers **01‚Äì26**, with optional symbol support for extended messages.

**Encryption & Decryption Panels**  
Visualize the full message transformation ‚Äî from plaintext to ciphertext and back,  in real time.

**Step-by-Step Math Breakdown**  
Each stage of RSA math is clearly explained and animated for learning purposes.

**Error Handling + Input Validation**  
Smart checks catch invalid primes, characters, and unsupported input types, with helpful messages.

**100% Offline Application**  
Runs entirely on your device , no web server, no uploads, just fast, secure local computation.

**Debug Mode & Educational Hints**  
Toggle debug mode to show raw values, intermediate results, and contextual explanations at every step.
