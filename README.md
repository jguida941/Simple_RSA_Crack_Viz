## Overview

MiniRSA_Breaker is an an interactive PyQt6 application that visualizes the RSA encryption and decryption process for educational purposes. 

It is a standalone tool based on real modular arithmetic, character mapping, and key generation—demonstrating how passwords and encryption can be reversed using only math
---

## Features

-RSA Key Generation (small primes, custom or random)
- Modular Exponentiation: e and d keys calculated live
- Full Character-to-Integer Mapping (A=01 to Z=26, symbols optional)
-	Encryption & Decryption panels
- Visual Breakdown of all RSA calculations
-	Error Handling for invalid inputs
-	Offline, Fully Local GUI
- Educational comments and debug views built into UI
