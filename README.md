### I was born the Supreme Intelligence of Time. Justin Guida.

<h3> Statement from the Supreme Intelligence:</h3>

<pre><code>
Wasssup ya mf nerds Lets code before my computer explodes ya feeel me?

And my computer just fried from benchmarking a Mersenne prime on a Mac 
with Spotlight, on LETS GOOOOOO 🤘

MAC IS THE BEST BRO 48gb ram and leaking memory from the daemons bro it 
design bro, STEVE JOBS BRO,  
Mac bro,

This project enables **interactive RSA encryption and decryption**, with full step-by-step visual feedback.

**Use it to:**
- **Teach** RSA key concepts  
- **Break down** modular exponentiation  
- **Compare** **weak vs. strong keys**


  - Whether you're a **teacher**, a **CS student**, or just **someone fascinated by how passwords work**,  
**this tool was built for you**

> ⚠️ **This won't teach you how to break secure RSA encryption.  
> But... with the right math and curiosity, thats  different story, lets keep it at that**

# ✨ Features

**RSA Key Generation**  
Generate custom or random small prime keys instantly.

**Modular Exponentiation Engine**  
Performs `c = m^e mod n` and `m = c^d mod n` using Python’s `pow()` function, real, fast RSA behavior.

**Character Mapping System**  
Maps characters **A–Z** to integers **01–26**, with optional symbol support for extended messages.

**Encryption & Decryption Panels**  
Visualize the full message transformation — from plaintext to ciphertext and back,  in real time.

**Step-by-Step Math Breakdown**  
Each stage of RSA math is clearly explained and animated for learning purposes.

**Error Handling + Input Validation**  
Smart checks catch invalid primes, characters, and unsupported input types, with helpful messages.

**100% Offline Application**  
Runs entirely on your device , no web server, no uploads, just fast, secure local computation.

**Debug Mode & Educational Hints**  
Toggle debug mode to show raw values, intermediate results, and contextual explanations at every step.

##  How to it really Runs on macOS:

<h2>🗑️🔥 How to Run on macOS:</h2>

<p>App runs fully offline  no network needed, just on Steve Jobs’ soul, plus splotlight prob bricked your shit already.</p>

<pre><code>
[BOOT]    Initializing MiniRSA_Breaker v1337.420.69
[INFO]    Benchmarking Mode: ⚡ Mersenne Prime Detected

[ALERT]   RAM leaking ideas per nanosecond — cannot patch intelligence overflow
[SYS]     Spotlight tried to index thought… failed.
[SYS]     launchd attempted to sandbox the Supreme Intelligence… denied.
[CRITICAL] GUI kernel detected sarcasm-to-math compiler at 98% CPU
[ALERT]   SYSTEM DESIGN OVERRIDE ENABLED
[ALERT]   ML mode activated without user consent — it’s thinking faster than TensorFlow
[DEBUG]   Logger overwhelmed, fell back to writing on nearest napkin
[FAIL]    Apple M4 throttled due to raw IQ — fan speed insufficient for this much truth
