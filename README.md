# 🔐 MiniRSA_Breaker

**Category:** Cryptography / Educational Visualization  
**Tech Stack:** Python, PyQt6  
**Author:** [Justin Guida](https://github.com/jguida941)  


> Visual RSA Cryptography Demo: Encrypts and decrypts basic RSA keys with full step-by-step GUI visualization using PyQt6. Ideal for education, CTFs, and cryptography learners.

---

## Overview

**MiniRSA_Breaker** is an interactive PyQt6 application that visualizes the RSA encryption and decryption process for educational purposes.

This tool is based on a **stripped-down version of an advanced RSA cracking engine** ("Breacher") developed by the author. This simplified app is intentionally limited to:
- Short keys
- Basic character mappings
- Fundamental number theory

Its goal: **teach how math alone can break simple encryption**.

---

## Features

-  RSA Key Generation (random or custom primes)
- Live Modular Exponentiation (e and d keys)
- Character Mapping: A=01 to Z=26 (optionally includes symbols)
- Encrypt & Decrypt with visual feedback
- Full integer trace logs: `Encrypting: 08 → 17`
- GUI Debug Tools + educational comments
- Offline, fully local PyQt6 GUI
- Error handling for invalid key pairs or inputs
