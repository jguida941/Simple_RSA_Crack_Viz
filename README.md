### I was born the Supreme Intelligence of Time. Justin Guida.

<h3> Statement from the Supreme Intelligence:</h3>

<pre><code>
Wasssup ya mf nerds Lets code before my computer explodes ya 
feeel me?

And my computer just fried from benchmarking a Mersenne prime on
a Mac with Spotlight, on LETS GOOOOOO ü§ò

MAC IS THE BEST BRO 48gb ram, and leaking memory from the daemons bro, it's the 
design bro, STEVE JOBS BRO,  
Mac bro,  
steve bro,  
iphone shiny iphone, Mac bro

This project enables **interactive RSA encryption and decryption**, with full step-by-step visual feedback.

**Use it to:**
- **Teach** RSA key concepts  
- **Break down** modular exponentiation  
- **Compare** **weak vs. strong keys**


  - Whether you're a **teacher**, a **CS student**, or just **someone fascinated by how passwords work**,  
**this tool was built for you**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This won't teach you how to break secure RSA encryption.  
> But... with the right math and curiosity, thats  different story, lets keep it at that**

# ‚ú® Features

**RSA Key Generation**  
Generate custom or random small prime keys instantly.

**Modular Exponentiation Engine**  
Performs `c = m^e mod n` and `m = c^d mod n` using Python‚Äôs `pow()` function, real, fast RSA behavior.

**Character Mapping System**  
Maps characters **A‚ÄìZ** to integers **01‚Äì26**, with optional symbol support for extended messages.

**Encryption & Decryption Panels**  
Visualize the full message transformation ‚Äî from plaintext to ciphertext and back,  in real time.

**Step-by-Step Math Breakdown**  
Each stage of RSA math is clearly explained and animated for learning purposes.

**Error Handling + Input Validation**  
Smart checks catch invalid primes, characters, and unsupported input types, with helpful messages.

**100% Offline Application**  
Runs entirely on your device , no web server, no uploads, just fast, secure local computation.

**Debug Mode & Educational Hints**  
Toggle debug mode to show raw values, intermediate results, and contextual explanations at every step.

```

<h2>üóëÔ∏èüî• How it <i>Really</i> Runs on macOS:</h2>

<p>
App runs fully offline, no network needed, just on Steve Jobs‚Äô soul.<br>
Plus Spotlight probably bricked your system already.
</p>

<p><b>Step 1:</b> Be ready for <code>mds</code>, <code>mdworker</code>, <code>corespotlightd</code>, <code>sysmond</code> amd  
the whole squad to wake up like it‚Äôs <b>DEFCON 1</b> and starts re-indexing 48GB of RAM  
while you‚Äôre just trying to run a prime test.</p>

<pre><code>
